"""
The retrieval grader acts as a quality control mechanism that evaluates whether retrieved documents are actually relevant to the user's question. 
This component is crucial because vector similarity alone doesn't guarantee relevance â€” documents might be semantically similar but contextually inappropriate.
The GradeDocuments model ensures we get a clean binary decision from the LLM. The system prompt instructs the grader to look for both explicit keywords and semantic meaning, providing a comprehensive relevance assessment. This grading step prevents irrelevant documents from contaminating our generation process and triggers web search when local documents are insufficient.
